Personal Lisp utility functions and macros that are not part of
any larger module suitable for general release. I use some of
these functions across projects, academic and personal, to avoid
continually reinventing the oddly-shaped wheels to my liking.

Occasionally some terrible ideas or implementations will slip
into the library this library -- use your judgement.
In particular I find myself reinventing some tools that have
already been written or are even standard -- such
as CL-UTILITIES:COLLECTING and DESTRUCTURING-BIND -- before I
learn of their existence. I try to eliminate such redundancies.

As this is a "personal" utility library I feel no particular
obligation to present a consistent API. Feel free to copy
anything you like, or to use a snapshot, but depending on
up-to-date versions of this package is probably a bad idea
for any projects not maintained by me personally. If you
feel something is of general interest and should be in its own
package, feel free to contact me (or just fork it off yourself).
